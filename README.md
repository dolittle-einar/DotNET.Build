# DotNET.Build

Common build for all .NET Based projects.

## Setting up a new project

### Sub module

This project should be a Git sub-module of your project.

```shell
$ git submodule add https://github.com/dolittle/DotNET.Build.git Build
```

### CSharp Project file

In order for the assembly name to be unique, add the following:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <AssemblyName>Dolittle.{full name of package}</AssemblyName>
</PropertyGroup>
```

You can also import the default properties for a .NET Core project.

```xml
<Import Project="../../Build/MSBuild/default.props"></Import>
```

For specification projects you should use the `specs.props`

```xml
<Import Project="../../Build/MSBuild/specs.props"></Import>
```

## Visual Studio Code settings

In the `.vscode` folder there is a certain configuration set up that should enable you to get up and running pretty fast with things like building and running specifications, debugging and similar.
Since **Visual Studio Code** honors the settings in the `.vscode` folder local to your project you can easily create a symbolic link that points to this. The beauty about symbolic links is that they'll be part of the Git repository as well - meaning that everyone will have this benefit once it has been set up.

You create a symbolic link using the following:

```shell
$ ln -s /some/source/location /some/destination/location
```

Concretely this could be something like this:

```shell
$ ln -s ./Build/.vscode ./.vscode
```

This all depends on the location of things. For instance in projects with multiple projects within Source, you might have a different setup. You **MUST** use relative paths however.
It does however assume you have your `.vscode` folder on the level in which you're opening the workspace, as it will look for a `resolveProject.js` file to help it do the resolving of paths depending on the different tasks you give it.

### Visual Studio Code Tasks

In the `.vscode` folder sits a setup for different tasks that helps you get the most out of your development experience. You'll find `build`, `debug`, `restore` and `test` related tasks.
These tasks can quite easily be mapped to keyboard shortcuts, for instance like this (Press F1 -> "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts File"). In the keybindings.json you can then add the following to the array:

```json
[
    {
        "key": "shift+f6",
        "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
        "args": "build current"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+alt+f5",
        "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
        "args": "test debug"
    },
    {
        "key": "ctrl+shift+f5",
        "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
        "args": "tests no dependencies"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+alt+shift+f5",
        "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
        "args": "tests rerun"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+shift+r",
        "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
        "args": "restore"
    }
]
```

This gives you the following:

| Key-binding | Purpose |
| ----------- | ------- |
| shift+f6    | Build current project based on currently open file, locates closest .csproj file |
| cmd+alt+f5  | Runs tests for current project based on open file with debugger, debugger must be in attach mode and you can eventually attach it |
| ctrl+shift+f5 | Runs tests for current project based on open file without building dependencies |
| cmd+alt+shift+f5 | Reruns last testrun |
| cmd+shift+r |Â Restore packages for current project based on open file |

## AppVeyor

AppVeyor is the main build service used for .NET projects. It is responsible for compiling, packaging and deployment of packages.
